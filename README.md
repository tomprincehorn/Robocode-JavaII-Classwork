# Robocode-JavaII-Classwork

This program is what I used to compete in a Robocode battle with my Java 2 classmates. Constraints for this project included only using the robot class rather than the advancedrobot class, and the program had to incorporate several methods, including an onWallHit method, an onScannedRobot method, and an onRobotHit method.
